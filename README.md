## Overview

This n8n workflow enables automatic invoice processing for businesses and freelancers. Invoices (as PDF or images) sent via Telegram are:

1. **Stored** in a year-wise folder on Google Drive.
2. **Parsed** using OpenAI (GPT-4o) for extraction of key invoice data.
3. **Logged** and updated in a Google Sheet.
4. **Summarized** and communicated back to the user on Telegram.

## Detailed Workflow Explanation

### 1. Folder & File Preparation

- Checks if a Google Drive folder for the current year exists under the main "Invoices" directory.
- If not, creates the folder and copies a template Google Sheet ("Invoices") into it, renaming it with the year.
- Ensures an "Invoices_Summary_{YEAR}" sheet exists per year.

### 2. Invoice Processing

- Triggered by a new document sent to the Telegram bot.
- Sends an initial "processing..." message to the user.
- Downloads the file and determines its type (PDF or image).
- Extracts text or data using the appropriate OpenAI model:
  - **PDF:** Extracts text, then prompts GPT-4o to parse invoice fields.
  - **Image:** Sends image to GPT-4o Vision for document parsing.
- Parses and validates the structured data (e.g., vendor, invoice #, dates, totals).
- Uploads the original file to the correct Drive folder and shares a public link.
- Updates the corresponding Google Sheet with the extracted data, matching on Invoice# to avoid duplicates.
- Sends a summary message to the user containing parsed invoice data.

### 3. Error Handling

- If any step fails (e.g., extraction, upload, sheet update), notifies the user via Telegram with a clear error message and suggestions.
